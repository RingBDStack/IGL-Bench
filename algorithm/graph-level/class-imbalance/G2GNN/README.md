This repository is an $1^{st}$ official PyTorch(Geometric) implementation of GNN-based machine learning models for handling imbalanced graph classification.

See more details for the paper ['Imbalanced Graph Classification via Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks'](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3511808.3557356)

## Run
Note that compared to the previous verion of this repository, we move the K-nearest neighbor search in topological space into the batch-processing, which hence can be speed up due to parallel preparation. Furthermore, to solve the undeterministic issue, we replace the original [scatter-based message-passing/pooling](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/scatter.html) with sparse-matrix multiplication-based message-passing and [segment_csr-based pooling](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/segment_csr.html), see more details [[here]](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/sparse_tensor.html)
